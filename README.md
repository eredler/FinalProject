possible ideas:
-solar system creator
-finals week simulator

1/5/15
start work on finals week simulator

multiple slots in the day for choices (mon-fri) --> ex: during study hall, choose to sleep/talk/study

make abstract student class then instances for each grade level

  beginning stress level increases as grade level increases

  efficiency of study increases?

  difficulty of finals/classes increases

can choose to cheat on finals with chance of getting caught based on sleep, preparedness, etc

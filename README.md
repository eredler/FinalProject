features discussed:

  multiple slots in the day for choices (mon-fri) --> ex: during study hall, choose to sleep/talk/study
  
  make abstract student class then instances for each grade level
  
    beginning stress level increases as grade level increases
  
    efficiency of study increases?
  
    difficulty of finals/classes increases
  
  can choose to cheat on finals with chance of getting caught based on sleep, preparedness, etc
